# House-Price-Prediction
Predict house prices from a Kaggle dataset

The dataset contains a large number of features of house sold in a particular area over a 5 year period. The task is to predict the selling price of houses in the test set. I find the best way to do it is an ensemble of linear models, neural net and gradient boosting decision trees.
